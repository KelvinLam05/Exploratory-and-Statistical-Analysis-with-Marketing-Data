"Good quality products, cues need work. Primark is a great store in which you can buy decent clothing at a decent price. They are very ethical with makeup and how they source their clothes and overall the quality is pretty amazing for the price. Had a few holes here and a few sizing issues there but Primark always seem happy to exchange or refund those items with my receipt.

I have seen many reviews complain about the policy, however the policy is there to cover their back from theft and people returning stolen goods. I also saw a comment asking why they don‚Äôt do e-receipts but I expect it is because of the immense cues in Primark. The cues are long and hot and bothering enough without making it longer by taking down email addresses and phone numbers. Just keep your receipts!! The stricter the policy, the better it is for Primark, no silly loopholes for dishonest people to jump through. 

Generally a great store and I shop here often. Air con could do with some work and the cues could be reduced with more staffing. Otherwise it would be a 5 star review :)",4,Primark,trustpilot,2019-07-08
"The most frustrating website in the world I love the bargains that Primark offers. In store, it is excellent for picking up some plain shirts or shoes at a crazy low price. However the website is truly terrible. Although there seems to have been some recent improvements, it is still relatively useless in comparison to other shopping sites. I fully understand that Primarks range is constantly changing, therefore updating the site must be a bit of a nightmare, but even if they didn't offer online shopping, they could perhaps offer showing ranges of what they offer so you know what to expect when going into the store.",2,Primark,trustpilot,2012-03-12

"False Economy Primark may be temptingly cheap but everything I have ever purchased from there has brought home the old adage, ""Buy Cheap, Buy Twice"".  I no longer shop there and prefer to save up for better quality versions.  The only way I could justify ever shopping there again would be when buying for babies / small children as the life span of their clothing is much shorter, making spending lots of money to buy them a waste.  Having said that the fact that their supply chain allegedly has some very questionable links (i.e. workers in developing countries not being paid a living wage by Primark sub-contractors in order to keep wholesale prices as low as possible) makes me feel uncomfortable about buying from there at all.",2,Primark,trustpilot,2012-02-13

"Amazing SportsWear 10/10 I can honestly say Primark have the best sportswear to date. I say this as I'v been trying to find a decent pair of leggings for age, that high waited and shape lifting . I have ordered and tried on so many well known brands that are a lot more expensive but aren‚Äôt affective and I can definitely say Primark has beaten all the expensive sportswear brands. 

However, I will say it's a shame  they don't bring out new sportswear regularly, with the same material as the stretchy cotton fabric that's used for some of the leggings are really good. 
Highly recommend their sportswear for sure.

I am on benefits and every penny counts!The checkout girl then called this supervisor 'Sandra' who promptly marked off to the jumper section tucked away in a corner, I went with her sensing her severity. I said you have a sign here saying ¬£5 (per jumper) and yet when you get to the check out its nearly ¬£8. All I said its misleading (for the public)...she was having none of that, I said I think I am allowed to express my opinion (unless we are living in a fascist dictatorship?). She then turned nasty saying that she worked there from 8am-8pm, all I retorted was that I was allowed to express my opinion? She seems to think not and had already 'called security' (probably too many american movies) while I was back at the checkout.

"Disgusting Behaviour from store staff when trying to exchange item I bought some clothes before the recent lockdown. Was unable to exchange an item due to lockdown. Now in May as the lockdown is over, I took the item a trouser back to my local store in Romford to do an exchange but they would not let me as I did not have the receipt. I asked that I don‚Äôt want a refund a gift voucher or an exchange would be acceptable but I was told no. A manager was called and she reiterated that an exchange can‚Äôt be done without a receipt. I told her I did not have the receipt as we were in lockdown for 3 - 4 months and it was misplaced. I am always buying things from Primark and asked them if they can make an exception in this case as the item was unused with tags. They could easily Have exchanged with the items I bought but the manager was being rude. I said the situation was outside of my control due to COVID. You don‚Äôt really expect to keep receipts for 6 months do you. She basically said we can‚Äôt do anything that‚Äôs are policy. She then went on to say ‚Äúwell that‚Äôs not my problem if you did not keep the receipt‚Äù.  I was left shocked with the attitude and in the end left the item behind because it was too small for me and no good to keep. They simply took back the trousers and left it in the returns rack. So now they will simply re-sell the item and I am left out of pocket. 

This is disgusting behaviour from Primark. No empathy for customer where the situation was outside my control due to pandemic. I appreciate you need to have a receipt to exchange / refund but honesty do people keep receipts for 6 months?

The two staff dealing with me were extremely rude, unprofessional. The manager was like a robot and was being sarcastic. This is unacceptable behaviour. One assistant was being sympathetic, a young guy and apologised about the situation after the manager left and said he completely understood my situation but he could not do anything.

So my question is: 
1. are these managers not trained in customer service?  Why are they so rude?

2. Why can‚Äôt there be an exception made in this case. I was willing accept a credit note, gift voucher

3. With Other retailers I had a very positive experience where without a receipt they either gave me a credit note/ voucher or simply exchanged the item.

Disgusting behaviour - will no longer shop with Primark. Also will be raising a feed in Twitter. I‚Äôm sure other people experienced this unacceptable behaviour.

Pretty decent It's true that the products aren't always of the best quality but the cheaper price reflects that. Most of the stuff will last a decent amount of time and is comfortable to wear/desirable to use. I especially like the bedding and homeware products. Products constantly changing so you're more driven to return. One issue is the queues because it tends to be quite hectic but fortunately stores are usually well staffed and so your purchasing experience won't take too long.,4,Primark,trustpilot,2019-06-02

"Great Brilliant and easy to use website. Great for inspiration. Most of the stores I have visited are also brilliant. Staff are very helpful and rather knowledgeable.

However I have learned that some of the items/clothing/products shown on the website are not sold in all stores. Or they won't be in the store for a weeks after they have been released. Therefore it can be a hit and miss if you really wanted to buy a specific item.
 
Popular items tend to go very quickly. (understandable as many people visit the store). 1 week there will be something you like, the next week it would most likely be out of stock or not in stock at the moment.

Quality of clothing is either good, okay or bad. Jeans are okay, but they don't have the stretchiness compared to the jeans they sell in other highstreet SHOPS. The ""Superstretch skinny jeans"" go very baggy after a few washes, ""Body sculpt"" often feel very tight around the legs but really big around the bum and often just fall down. The ""Basic ones"" just don't fit nice. Black jeans lose their colour very quickly too. T'shirts are great, jumpers are quite short if you are a tall person. Socks tend to be rather tight and not stretchy or end up going tight after few times wearing them.",5,Primark,trustpilot,2019-01-18

My fiancee pointed out that he was very rude to both of us, and it felt like I was leaving work at Sports Direct the way he detained us.He also ranted on about me not being allowed to try clothes on, to which I replied:`I have bought the goods that I tried on, and I actually tried them on in the fitting room`.He was very lucky I did not respond with an equally hostile manner, nevertheless, I believe, someone with that sort of personality defect should not be allowed near any of Primark`s  `valued `customers.He is very short for security guard, about 5`4"" , and also very fat, not to mention his ugly disposition and attitude, nevertheless he made up for his short fat, statuture,by utilising a loud and uncouth manner, shouting in a loud voice, which was totally unnecessary, as the shop was not busy.",1,Primark,trustpilot,2016-09-24

"would you shop there if you had a conscience? I work in the Bristol store for a number of years. If your face doesn‚Äôt fit, you will get bullied by the managers and supervisor. The bullying got so bad, my health and mental health suffered. I did try to complain about it but I was stitched up by the managers and supervisors who lied through their teeth and made out I was a liar. I did try to complain to Primark head office but they just covered up everything. I even wrote two letters to the owners Associated British Foods but never got a reply. It got so bad, in 2015 I nearly committed suicide twice due to the bullying. I tried to complain about the way I was treated but it got worse with lies and bullying. I even got a warning for being ill. It got to a stage when I was put on sick leave with severe depression. In the end I got the sack for being ill. I tried to get in touch with Primark and George Weston at Associated British Foods but never heard back from both parties. 
I did try to complain about the way I was treated on Facebook, but I had a phone call from Primark saying if I put anything up on Facebook about what happened to me, they will take me to court and crush me at the end of 2015.  Not only was it the bullying that didn‚Äôt help my self esteem, but the fact they expected me to work overtime without pay. All they are concern about is profit and not the health of their employees. This is a very short version of what happened to me at Primark Bristol. 
If you had a conscience, would you shop there knowing they don‚Äôt care about their employees and only care about profit?

Eventually the manager came and we went over the same discussion several times, with the implication from both staff members that the receipt referred to something else & I was trying to get the ¬£10 for something I had picked from the shop floor. Eventually, the manager scanned the item & surprise surprise it scanned as ¬£10 matching my receipt. Absolutely no apology for the mistake from either member of staff, no acknowledgement of their mistake as opposed to mine, and each of them blaming the other. Absolutely terrible customer experience.

Holidays could not be taken when wanted, forced to take days off during the year, unable to swap shifts with other supervisors although proof could be provided for a valid reason however when suited other supervisors were given the go ahead - racist managers maybe..?

"A Review Of The Kingfisher Centre, Redditch branch This is a review of the branch in the Kingfisher Centre, Redditch.  It is, without doubt, one of the very worst shops that I have ever been in.  The shop is always crowded, there is always a very long ( and very slow) queue at the checkouts and the staff are never very friendly or cheerful.  Most of the time, they barely acknowledge my presence at all.  I don't appreciate being snubbed when I am spending my money inside a store, but this has happened here on several occasions.  The same thing has happened in WH Smith too, which is just as bad as this awful place.

The only reason why this shop is still in existence is because they are cheap and they sell very cheap rubbish for next to nothing.  It's a shop for cheapskates, like ALDI and LIDL.  If you do decide to ignore my review and buy clothes from here, be aware that there is a very good chance that they will disintegrate as soon as you wash them.  This is the kind of cheap and tacky place where you buy clothes, wear them once and then throw them away.  I think that it is an awful place to shop and there are plenty of other decent clothes shops out there.  I have learnt my lesson and I will never set foot inside a branch of Primark ever again.  This shop is only for people who like cheap, disposable rubbish.",1,Primark,trustpilot,2020-04-14

"Getting too big for their boots On the whole I think primark is a good company. On the downside I have noticed as they are getting more recognised around the world items have also gone up in price. This is a pretty normal thing to do, however if it's not made properly then there's a problem. Most items do not last long due to how they are made and I feel fitting is a real big problem. 
I can't tell you how many times I have seen women on the streets wearing tops and jumpers that look like they were made for height of a 10 year old. It's such a shame because I personally like the design and style of most items they sell but it's not worth it. If you're thinking about buying a top priced at ¬£9.99 or ¬£14.99 you may as well go to H&M or New Look because it's better quality and sized correctly. 
After being let down in countless dresses not being stitched together properly and impossible sizing. Example, neck is too small to get your head through, I mean how hard is it to make a size ten. 
I find myself more of a Primark window shopper now and resist temptation and move on to H&M",2,Primark,trustpilot,2017-09-01

"My terrible experience working at the Braintree mall. I used to work here and it was good for the first month but then all the managers started to yell at us for no reason. They said we can talk to our friends while working or if my friend came to see me at work you could talk to them but they would just come over and tell them that they are a distraction when technically they are a customer. Also all the managers say phones NEED to be in lockers cause you can‚Äôt be on them yet at the register and floor the managers are on FaceTime with people or doing something else on the phone. They treat  their workers poorly and yell at you if your a few minutes late on your break when we don‚Äôt even get paid on our breaks. They also tell us to tell customers that whatever we have out on the floor is what we have when we have the stock room packed with shipments but they are just too lazy to put out the clothes also cause the managers are mostly in the back  talking bad about employees and exaggerating things about them and on their phones doing nothing. I‚Äôm shocked that we are getting payed minimum wage for working while they get paid more for sitting on their butts doing nothing. And also bragging about how much money the store makes and that Primark will be the last store standing. I don‚Äôt know how they haven‚Äôt got fired but they went from 50-60 workers to now 20 because of how many people are quitting because of the managers. Also the store manager fired one of the managers and she was trying to get him fired and build a case on him so she had a reason to fire him and some managers also talked to me during my shifts about how they worked here for 3 years and has hated it ever since Because the store manager didnt care that he had family emergencies she said ‚Äúcome in or ur fired‚Äù. Next if you have an injury  and need to take a small break, the managers ask for a doctors note saying you need to take breaks during work and also try to get minors to sign their names on papers when their parent is not there. They also give you a paper to answer too personal questions that they are allowed to ask because their company is from a different country so their rules for their company aren‚Äôt legal in the U.S. There are other times where managers are rude to customers. This women came in 5 minutes after the store was closed because she left something that she had already paid for. The manager said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry we‚Äôre closed‚Äù then the women said ‚ÄúI just left something here that I paid for‚Äù and the manager started arguing with her saying she couldn‚Äôt get it when it would take two seconds to grab what she bought. The women threatened to call the police and then another manager helped her and said she was reporting the manager. Another time a kid bumped into a mannequin and a manager yelled at him saying ‚Äúyou have to be careful these are very expensive‚Äù which the mother didn‚Äôt like so the mother yelled at her for talking to her kid like and said ‚Äúwould you want me to talk to your kids like that‚Äù and she said yes without hesitation. The fact that these managers don‚Äôt care about people and only their business is awful.  They are terrible with customer service and the owner of this company needs to change the way they run the company so it‚Äôs legal in the U.S. cause these forms they try to make us sign are against the law and this whole company in general needs to either change the way they run this business or get different managers. Finally an ex-employee told one of the managers how he felt about them saying that they sucked and this whole store is bull and she felt threatened by a 16 year old boy and banned him from the store. If your threatened by a boy then you either need therapy or a job that doesn‚Äôt hire teenagers.

"Does Primark operate racial profiling? I rarely shop at Primark as I can't stand the crowds  and the long queues. This afternoon on my way to pick up my granddaughter from nursery, I had some time to kill and decided to pop into my local Wembley store to buy her a few bits, she grows fast and the stuff in Primark is cheap so works out ok. Got to the till, cashier enters my items, and I swipe my contactless debit card, she says oh, its been declined, I say, no not possible,( I have a gold account and keep certain balance on the account), so I swipe my card again, twice,same thing, I started to smell a rat, when she said you could just use your pin,  I have used my contactless card without any refusal in many stores on numerous occasions without payment been refused, the only store that seems to have a problem with me using my contactless card is Primark. Now if this was the first time I would have put it down to a glitch in their system, but guess what it has happened to me before, in the same store in Wembley. It was some time ago, when they first started using the contactless technology( at the time they were late to the technology upgrade, so I put that incident down to glitches in the system).I entered my pin, asked for my receipt and rang my bank and guess what, the  payments were never declined nor requested, seems someone cancelled the contactless transaction at source, so my bank never go a request for payment. So that means someone had decided, based on whatever profile they have of card fraudsters that I fitted the bill, and wanted to test if I was a fraudster by making me use my pin, (lucky I remembered it as I rarely use it).I am hoping this is not overall Primark policy and is just the management of the Wembley store, but, who knows. I was as mad as hell when I left the store and felt totally violated, being caught up in the racial profiling system is not a good feeling.

WHAT is going on in this world, The people who make them must have to wear them as well.. are they all small busted women?.  Please Primark the only bras I had a choice of were massive ugly non padded one which had straps so wide I could have used them for a belt.  You used to do a beautiful selection of bras nice lacy ones which fit round the breast perfectly. Not these horrible padded foam things, that as soon as you lean forward slightly they seem to stay put and form a ledge!!.   Please think about this and maybe half the padded stock into non padded stock. The padded bras are taking over the world, and there's a lot of women who hate them. well anyone over a C cup do and funny enought thats probably a much bigger percentage than you think as us women have been getting bigger boobs for the last 20 years.   Half your stock of these padded nightmares and get back in the nice lacey bras which fit you nicely I dont want to wear a T shirt for the rest of my live!!!",2,Primark,trustpilot,2015-05-02

I joined the que after waiting there for a fair amount of time i went to register 7  and a woman scanned my products and i paid for them and walked away but then stopped and probably looked at my receipt then realised i had been charged ¬£2; it wasn't the amount of money that they had charged me it was the principle so i went back less than a couple of seconds after i had paid and said to the lady "" i thought this product was ¬£1"" she reluctantly took my recipt and scanned the product she said it came up as ¬£2 but I insisted that it wasn't because of what the sign said ( the sign unlike other shops didn't have the name of the product, its number or a barcode just a simple ¬£1 sign) after asserting myself she then got one of her colleges to go and check which took a while and i needed to catch a train she came back and persisted that it was ¬£2 and it was a new range so she couldn't do anything about it. Feeling anoyed i asked for a refund I didn't want to give them my money when they had blatent disregard for me as a customer and she stated that she couldnt refund it and i had to go down to the customer survives and argue my point there so i still said "" but it was advertised as ¬£1. By this time i had been there for so long with no help and just plain disrespect that I didn't have any time left to go down to customer services and have the same conversation i had just had for the last 10 minutes so I reluctantly had to leave it but i said on principle that i would not go back as i felt i was disrespected as a customer.

Well of course I have worn them, that's how I know the quality was unsellable and that they aren't right for me.

The employee serving me called a member of management over and instead of being professional and speaking to my face he hid in the back room with the employee and just shook his head - how rude.

Annoyed me so much as I work in retail and there is no way you should be rejected for a refund when you've hardly worn something.

"Bad customer service I had a very bad experience yesterday when visited the Oxford street East store.

The children's fitting rooms are shared with the men's fitting rooms which I think is extremely unacceptable. Although inside there's separate areas still the entrance is shared with men where kids have to queue next to them and there's always men walking in and out of the area. I really don't understand what went through the person who design that shop's head that that was a good idea!!

When sorting out my shopping basket at the kids department I was told by a shop assistant that I couldn't use the table to do such. She approached me in a loud and rude voice as if I was spitting on the floor or doing another horrible thing. The department was quiet there was not much people browsing and the clothes that I was sorting out weren't many. I had 3 dresses in a pile and 2 t-shirts and a bikini in another neat pile aside. I was actually folding the clothes in neat piles and trying some dresses on my daughter over her clothes so I didn't have to use the ridiculous busy, messy and shared fitting rooms. 

The shop assistant decided to fight with me instead of helping me showing me other options around. I also replied saying there wasn't any dedicated fitting area for kids and she told me where they were, I replied that was unacceptable as they were shared with men and she told me to go there and ask for the kids fitting rooms there as there was a separate area which I replied that I have been there already. She never tried to accompany me to show me anything or even help me find a better place to do what I was doing. She pointed in the direction of a ridiculous small bench away from the mirror where I could sort out my basket she didn't even tried to show me where it was or go with me to see the messy horrible state of the place she was mentioning.

Around the store in other departments other shop assistants were talking in groups while tidying up the store without noticing clients or helping them. They were talking loud about personal subjects.

At the till I was received by a girl who didn't smile, looked at me or even open her mouth to say the amount of money I had to pay to her. She only talked to me to say that the receipt was on the bag and to say good evening, not even a thank you....

The shop was messy, dirty and was difficult to find anything in that mess. The rails were full of clothes with repeated sizes and there was not an even distribution of different sizes available.

It was a very bad experience that I don't want to repeat. I don't intend to go back again.

Just because this is a cheap clothing shop that doesn't mean you treat your customer like if they are scum. You should treat everyone nicely and be attentive of what is happening and not just assume that all customers are uneducated rude people. I could clearly understand that the shop assistant was untrained and had poor customer service experience. There was no excuse for that behaviour.",1,Primark,trustpilot,2015-05-23

"You gets wot you pays for Although Primark is good and carries a lot of stuff and at good prices, sometimes the quality of the items is a bit iffy, for instance, I bought 2 pairs of shoes (womens) at ¬£15 each, and they only lasted one season, I was not wearing them every day either, the heels wore down quickly and they got very scruffy looking very quickly. One pair, the dye even ran onto my feet when it rained.  Also some of the clothes sizes and styles are odd and it is best to try on stuff first to make sure it 'hangs' right, otherwise it is not a case of 'one size fits all' as some stuff just doesn't look right even though it looks good on the hanger!",3,Primark,trustpilot,2012-06-16

They wrote to confirm that a receipt was issued.  They can see my payment- they even asked for photos of the items with the tags on which I supplied. They wrote back to say a receipt was issued so there was nothing they could do.  I asked them to reconsider their response as they had clearly been able to locate my transaction.  Their response today was they  can‚Äôt exchange because I do not have a receipt!  I KNOW I DONT - I was asking them for a goodwill gesture.
I have friends who work in other well known stores who have said they could easily print a copy from the information I provided as I paid by card.

Therefore you have to ring Primark to see if they have it in stock. This was very inconvenient for me because I had quite a lot of things that I wanted to buy and would have probably been sat on the phone with them for around 2 hours. So overall I love Primark.

"Irreparably stinking clothes - they do nothing about it You can buy a lot of good clothes at primark. The quality is average but good value for the money. If you prefer changing your clothes often for cheap then this is a good place.

BUT: I've recently bought two black shirts that were stinking badly. Tried to wash them 5 times with various washing powders and gels on various temperatures but the clothes evaporated an unbearable smell while drying so I had to put them to the garden and the toilet to dry.

I've tried to return it and ask them to remove the shirts from the shelves but the customer service told they don't feel any bad smell on my clothes or the ones on their shelves. (They will sell the rest of those shirts to some unlucky customers.) Since I don't like playing with my health I trashed the shirts on the street. A few minutes later I went back to look around and asked another staff member (outside the customer service) to sniff at the shirts on the shelves. She felt nothing but when I asked her to compare the black shirt with the blue one of the same type she confirmed that the black has a stronger smell. Here is the thing: It has even stronger when you wash it and the water evaporates from it while drying. I felt the blue one to be fresh, the black has an unbearable smell: probably some unnatural colouring agent that doesn't fall under regulations when importing.

I don't ask you to avoid primark. You get good value for the money. But avoid customer support. They either didn't care in my case or their nose were so desensitised by their stinking clothes that they really didn't feel the terrible smell. I've wasted 2 hours travelling there and back to ask for a refund and the removal of the shirts from the shelves and my hourly rate is higher than the two shirts together. It was a waste of my time and money but at least I've learned something. Check the clothes carefully and if you buy something bad it is probably better to trash it than wasting your time with customer support or endangering your health.

When you consider buying something check not only for manufacturing defects but also for unnatural bad smell. In my case it smelled similar to the head of a match or a weird version of machine oil. You can't wash it out, it transfers to the washing machine and other clothes. Before this incident I never researched this topic online but I was surprised to find out that these chemicals can be very dangerous to your health (just check out what chemicals are used to treat clothes) and manufacturers/importers don't have to show them on the labels.",3,Primark,trustpilot,2016-12-18

Fair enough they can't refund or exchange underwear because of hygiene. But it was so obvious they had not even been opened. Then I returned a Marvel T Shirt as it said XL on the hanger and it was a medium. 

At the time of the exchange I bought 5 more cheap t shirts at ¬£2.50 each meaning I had bought 20 t shirts in 2 days which is a lot but going on holiday. They charged me ¬£21 for 5 more t shirts so I questioned it as they are only ¬£2.50 each and she said it is right so I thought my shorts may have been slightly more expensive or something and I was rushing. 

When I checked my receipt they had not refunded the Marvel T shirt but they had charged me for the replacement one and took the old t shirt off of me. 

So I went into store today spending another ¬£110 and they practically made out I was lying that I gave them the t shirt yesterday and they were really nasty with me. I asked to speak to Ellas manager about 7 time and she refused on every occasion.

Fair enough I  was very abrupt back but I was calm to start with and she wound me up refusing for me to speak with her manager and then saying she would have to check CCTV to check for the t shirt coming back yesterday. 

So I said to Ella be my guest please check CCTV then she refused because she knew I was right. The best of it is my partner works for the shopping centre where primark is in Leeds and she even in not so many words call my partner a liar as well. 

Be careful what you buy in Primark and check the sizes and always double check what they have said you are returning and make sure they have scanned it as they will only call you a liar üòì",1,Primark,trustpilot,2017-05-30

"Once bitten twice shy! A branch of Primark recently opened near to where I live,  I bought a 5 pack of underpants ""Jersey Slip"" but was unable to actually see them properly because of the packaging they were MUCH skimpier than the picture on packaging showed and subsequently  a VERY POOR and uncomfortable fit. Another single pair (most expensive I've EVER purchased) bought at the same time were OK when bought, but a few washes later (hand washed - never in very hot water) had lost all elasticity. I had lost my receipt and one of 5 pack had been worn so I was unable to do much about it  - although a trip to trading standards has been contemplated. I would suggest anyone purchasing anything from Primark keeps their receipt very safe, although I personally won't be shopping there again.

I understand it is a monotonous task being on tills (also working in retail myself), so sometimes it is hard to make conversation with a customer, so I don't expect it. But talking to your colleague is just rude. You're doing a task, you should have full concentration on that task. I'm a supervisor and if my team do this, they're told to focus on their own customer.

"üî•PLEASE PLEASE take note üî•PLEASE PLEASE take note.  Do not buy their candles. I had a fire from a coconut based candle that burnt down , melted and went up in 2 foot flames. PRIMARK are refusing to take responsibility and recall a coconut based candle from their stores. 

I do not understand how Primark are happy to continue to allow the sale of a candle in a highly flammable coconut husk. It is shocking. I note in a BBC news item on social media in 2017, of a Christmas tree candle that caught alight. In that incident the article shows the customer had the time to take a photo of the fire and post it on social media. Primark responded and they removed the product in 24 hours.  I did not have the  time to take a photo and post it, as the fire was too far established and I had to act fast. I work for the emergency services, I am used to dealing with situations. My situation was far worse and had I not reacted when I did,   the fire would have taken hold and would have escalated beyond my control. 

A candle should be in a fireproof container, regardless of the wick burning down, regardless of a small label warning not to let the candle burn down to the the wick. This candle is in a wooden container and is not safe. Primark is clearly happy to accept the risk of not only adults buying this product, but children aswell. In addition my neighbour‚Äôs 12 year old daughter was with my daughter when she purchased the candle. She also purchased the same candle. The neighbour‚Äôs  daughter had her candle in her bedroom, next to her bed, but since my fire she hadn‚Äôt used the candle. 

Can Primark be certain that a child has read the fire risk warning on the small sticker under the candle? Can they risk a child lighting the candle and falling asleep and the wick burning down? 

Following my own experience, I believe the risk is too high to take. It should not take me to post my incident on social media for Primark to take action.",1,Primark,trustpilot,2020-03-31

On arriving home I realised these were unsuitable and attempted to get a refund. I was told that NO REFUNDS OR EXCHANGES possible on BOXERS, this is company policy and clearly stated on the rear of the receipt, and the Cashier would have informed me at time of purchase.
AT NO TIME WAS I TOLD THAT NO REFUNDS OR EXCHANGES CAN BE GIVEN FOR BOXERS ETC, by the Cashier who served me. Had I been told that there is no way I would have purchased these items.
Indeed her main concern was asking me to e petition up to get better Air Conditioning in the Store as it was an unbearable hot day
I have sent numerous emails to Primark, pointing out that I was never informed of company policy, and the fact that customers only get a receipt after purchasing items. So how can customers be aware of Company Policy without Purchase? Had I been told the Policy I would not have made the purchase. There were no Company Policy Signs/Notices re Refunds on Boxers at the Boxer Display area. The attitude of the Alleged Customer Service staff is a total disgrace. I have dealt with initially a lady called Jade then another lady Yvonne. These two individuals are like a pair of parrots, continually  squawking out ""Company Policy, Company Policy"", but do not answer specific questions. I am still awaiting as answer as to how a Customer can read the Policy on the rear of a Till Receipt until a purchase has been made. Had I been told as per company policy that cashiers should inform customers of the refund/returns policy at time of purchase Clearly had I been told this NO purchase would have been mad at all. Another fatuous comment was the Company Policy is available on the Primark Website. Silly silly me, I obviously should have spent time on the WWW, researching Primark Company Policy , prior to visiting the store and making a purchase, and carried the means to access the company website whilst in the store. I also asked one of the Redditch Store Supervisors if he ever read the rear of a Primark or any other store receipt. Strangely enough he would not give an answer other than to say that the details are on the receipt. I am also still awaiting details of details of someone at Head Office I can contact. Again no details given. 
The attitude of the Primark staff I have been unfortunate to have had dealings with over this matter is abysmal.
Be warned, make sure you fully research Primark Website before making a purchase!!!!!!!!!!!!

"Bad quality and off sizing Even though the clothes in this store are sometimes really cheap and seem to keep up with trends, good luck getting things that will last a while. For me, the average wear is about a week, sometimes less! People say 'you get what you pay for' but as an 'experienced shopper' I can guarantee you can find something that is great quality and as cheap as the clothes in Primark elsewhere. 



Good luck finding something that actually fits in your size in this store. I usually fit a range of 1-2 sizes but in primark the range is about 4 sizes!!! Yet another reason why I have stopped shopping with them.",1,Primark,trustpilot,2014-06-08

Great for kids :-) Have shopped at primary for years for myself. Once my daughter was born I started to get a lot of her stuff from Primark as well. The prices are great but the quality of the product is not so good hence the cheap prices they have. But I will say not everything I have bought has been low quality. More than likely when I have bought items in the sales they have been great for me. Baby and kids I think I a lot better quality. I would recommend shopping at Primark.

Then I went to this nominated manager and asked the same question, and without even looking at me properly, he said no. He doesn't even want to talk to a customer nicely. It was a horrible Indian fellow who doesn't have a small sense of what a customer care is. He doesn't even want to smile with a customer.

"Embarassing experience I have always bought , and been pleased  with, my knickers in Primark. . On 9 March I bought 2 x 4 packs of my usual style / usual size small. On the Sunday following I opened one of the packs to put in my underwear drawer and straight away noticed the garments were much smaller than usual , and too small. The next day I breezed into the store ready to exchange, The girl at customer services advised me in curt tones ""We don't exchange underwear for hygeine reasons"" I pointed out to her the immaculate state of the packs I was returning and explained the reason why . After some further discussion she agreed to get a ""manager"". I went through the reason for requesting an exchange , and eventually someone turned up. I had to go through this whole explanation again and meanwhile the queue , which included men  , was building up behind me. No exchanges .. company policy and sizing information was on the reverse of the packs. She didn't want to know about the fact that these were supposed to be the same size/style as my previous purchases. However after standing my ground and some further discussion she agreed to the exchange but she was ""bristling"" the whole time. I did not notice that this policy  is explained on the reverse of the receipt , but honestly does anyone look at the receipt when you are being rushed through a busy till point, and it certainly wasn't pointed out. Also the point I was trying to make was that maybe there had been a mistake on the sizing in the manufacturing process which needed to be addressed. That fell on deaf ears. Anyway apologies for the essay . What I don't understand is why this Manager didn't take me, the awkward customer , aside and let the Customer Services staff get on with dealing with  the other people waiting. Clearly no management skills. Needless to say Primark have lost a customer. I will never shop there again.",2,Primark,trustpilot,2018-04-02

My Wife bought a pair of jogging trousers from Primark 

I found that the sizing and dimensions were completely wrong 

I wrote to you highlighting my issue

I asked you what was reasonable and what reference I should include with my return 

You wrote back saying post was fine and Primark would cover the cost 

I again asked how I should reference the return 

You did not respond 

I wrote again with an alternative solution 

I did also point out that your customer service was a bit lacking 

You have not responded or acknowledged the receipt of my email 

I have been polite in all of my correspondence 

I wrote to Paul Marchant, but his email bounced back 

I am now on a mission to have this matter resolved and will continue to press until it is

I have never experienced that before in the store which is considered to be a very good and professional place to shop, however from my experience I was extremely surprised and disappointed at the way we got treated considering we were there for more than 30 mins and got followed the whole time. This isn't the first time this happened to my friend either,  she experienced that by the same security on a shopping trip there a week before with her friends. I am extremely disappointed and definitely not going to Primark on a weekend day just because I presume he is only a weekend security as I've never seen him during the week at Primark. On a positive note, I praise the week day security man there as he is always welcoming and very polite and professional.",1,Primark,trustpilot,2016-10-15

I find it absolutely vile of the company during the pandemic on the returns and exchange policy. All they are doing is taking our money and refusing to give it back in these hard times. I brought 2 high valued tops from one of the stores for myself, having getting the size i normally am i was at the time happy with my purchase. Unfortunately they wasn't the right fit i would of loved to try them on before i brought them but obviously that wasn't allowed due to COVID, i then went in to exchange them...not having an reciept as i must misplaced. I not once asked for my money back just a swap of sizes. Previous months before COVID this happened to me purchasing another item from Primark,this was exchanged no problems without a reciept. This time around i got told they change the policy 2 years ago and nothing not even a swap was eligible without the original reciept. I even showed them a clear bank statement of the purchase and they still said no. 

They have taken my money. Under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 surely this isn't allowed and illegal. It was only ¬£26 but in this time of need that is a lot of money to just give a way for an item of no use. Absolutely appalled by the response i got from the manager that day and also customer services a few days later. 
All via email now...no phone services which is another way of them dodging this matter.
I suggest you make sure you get the right size/piece of clothing and laminate your reciept. Or like me never shop with the scammers again.",1,Primark,trustpilot,2020-09-14

She gave me very cold response that she is not really interested to serve me and her reply was we don‚Äôt have sizes if they are not on shopfloor. Anyways I tried finding the trouser in the area myself as I knew she wasn‚Äôt telling me the truth. After a quick look around in the area I found the trousers myself.

When we come away on holiday, it always comes with the need for my Wife to enjoy some retail therapy. We had driven 42 miles especially, to visit a town with a Primark.

Having two incredibly well behaved dogs, a Cocker-Poo and a Golden-Doodle, I sat on a shoe fitting bench with dogs sat beside me, whilst my wife went on a sending spree.

When I was told to leave, I found my Wife with her arms full of clothes. We did as we were told, we left, abandoning what was obviously hundreds of pounds worth of clothes.

With so many shops closing, I'm amazed to find Primark turning away business and like so many other dog owners, having been banned, shall respect the ban and will never go through their doors again.

As it happened, my Wife finally spent just under a thousand pounds on clothes she didn't need. I was hoping being banned would save me money, alas, I was as unlucky as was Primark!

With an anti-social policy, I look to the day when Primark start closing its branches",1,Primark,trustpilot,2019-12-20

After that some other worker finally appeared so I have asked them for the same thing but rudely got told that every single size is out and she just walked off. Like really? Such a poor customer service. They don‚Äôt even know how to directly deal with people. I have realised that chatting with your workers on the shop floor during working hours is more important than actually helping the customers. Asking for help almost feels like it‚Äôs wrong and you shouldn‚Äôt be doing it when in the end that‚Äôs their job and that‚Äôs what they get paid for.

Primark too expensive bad quality I don't think the price of clothes go well with the quality of the products I think they overcharge way too much for their clothes.

There is also racks of jumpers and hoodies in there all size Small or XS I been checking for weeks for one particular hoodie and it's always Small or XS!!!

However, when I went to the store in Cardiff when I got home, they had no issue at all with me being able to exchange my top and get my money back in a voucher for my jacket. The service was excellent but I think my knowledge of customer service really helps the way that you get what you want. I think that if you need to return items then make sure that you have a receipt and know how customer service works. Also, the customer service staff are usually inexperienced students who have a part-time job in Primark.

"Primark Llanelli (Parc Pemberton) Primark Llanelli (Parc Pemberton). 

Two weeks ago, I bought a skirt from Primark Llanelli for my daughter. Brought it home and the skirt was too big. Upon searching for the receipt, I do not recollect having one and there wasn‚Äôt one in the bag. I returned to the store this weekend to ask for an exchange, a simple swap of sizes. I was told I could not have an exchange as I do not have the receipt. This is Primark‚Äôs policy. Hence I needed to travel home in search of a receipt I‚Äôm not sure was even put into the bag, hopefully find it and then travel back again, incurring more costs to myself (also not forgetting there are currently fuel shortages). Whilst the store employees were only following policy, I find this absurd that an honest customer like myself cannot make a purchase and simple swap of items without a receipt. However, if the item had been faulty, an exchange is offered. So a different customer could deliberately damage the zip (for example) and be offered an exchange without question! 

To what end is the receipt required? If it is merely for proof of purchase, then this too has connotations that Primark do not trust their customers. Also, if the receipt is of such importance then surely there are other ways Primark could secure this, such as emailing receipts just the same as other high street stores. 

I am so shocked and disappointed by the blaze attitude of Primark, where I consider myself to be a loyal customer (family of 4), like they are doing me a favour by serving me. 

May I just remind retailers that customers choose where to spend their money and I‚Äôd have thought no retailer can afford to lose custom over their competitors, more-so in the current climate! 

I am thoroughly disappointed.",1,Primark,trustpilot,2021-10-11

"""Improved"" sizing I have always been a fan of primark clothing. For years I could find things that fit me and were cheap enough for me to spend ¬£50 or so every few months. 
However now I'm struggling to find clothing that fit me and over the last few months I have barely bought anything from the store. The reason why?? It's because primark introduced that new ""improved"" sizes, which leaves me without sizes that fit me. 
They do sizes in 4-6, 6-8 and 10-12. Where does that leave me and probably a large number of women who sometimes end up wearing a size 8 or a size 10 trousers/leggings? 
6-8 size makes me look like a fat sausage it's so tight and size 10-12 hangs around the waist, drags around the ankles.

So how does this ""improved"" sizing works when as a store you can't produce a size 8-10 and no one in this big company noticed this blip? 

Somehow other stores manage to produce size 8 tops that fit perfectly and in primark a top 4-6 size is too tight and 6-8 ends up being too big. 

""Improved"" sizing will probably mark the end of my time in the primark stores, as it stands now.",2,Primark,trustpilot,2018-09-06

"Primark clothes left me in a spin. A few years ago, I bought a pair of men's briefs from Croydon's Surrey Primark and developed a boil under my groin area within two days after wearing them just once, and my GP told me that I had likely caught from the briefs and I told him I had only worn once. He told me that the boil I caught could be a fungus infection caught from the underpants. He also explained that he saw a few other patients (men and woman) presenting the same thing they reportedly caught from new underwear and had worn without washing after bought, albeit, I must say he never said they had all bought from Primark.  Nonetheless,  my GP urged me to always wash clothes when bought from new because ""new"" that we buy does not mean they are clean and can reduce the risk of skin disease and cross-infection"", and he educated me about how certain clothes can have parasites and, if not, can spread disease when customers try them on and for others to try, which never applied to my briefs for they were new but maybe had germs that caused my boil.

After the experience with briefs from Primark,  more recently my son did buy me socks for my birthday from the Primark branch in West End and just one day after wearing the socks, I developed severe itching on my lower legs, and a few days later, a rash emerged. I became concerned and saw a dermatologist friend, and they told me that I had Eczema, a problem I have never suffered with in my entire life.  My Dermatologist friend implied that it was the socks my son bought me from Primark, which was responsible for the rash and will have the rest of my life and with scarring due to chronic itching. 

Out of interest, I  have researched Primark online and saw that other people had similarly developed skin conditions allegedly from their clothing and not just them but from other sweatshop clothing outlets. My research showed that people could encounter major clothing outlets, like Primark, wool lice, skin disease and fungicide, etc.

My research also suggests that much of their clothes are manufactured in Bangladesh, where according to various media sources I have read, there has been considerable controversy about Primark and the like,  allegedly unethical practices in manufacturing processes, particularly in Bangladesh and other global mass production manufacturing hot spots where it cites serious health and safety concerns about the production of clothing.

I am not singling out Primark as I am sure other people have had a similar experience after wearing new clothes, socks and underwear elsewhere. I am only sharing my own personal experience with Primark clothes And why I do not wear clothes from there anymore.. And like my GP, I urge anyone reading this review to wash clothes more so underwear before wearing when bought new from Primark and anywhere else. I know what I am talking about my skin is permanently damaged. Had I washed my new underwear before wearing and the socks maybe I would be OK today. Who knows?",1,Primark,trustpilot,2021-05-04

So the following week returned to the store with the items once again and the original receipt to then be told, I still couldn‚Äôt do the exchange as receipt was out of the time limit by then (which was not explained in the first visit!)
Never had this problem in any other shops just to exchange. All in all I had 2 wasted trips & my son now has birthday presents he can‚Äôt even wear so waste of money too! This is likely to happen every Christmas/birthday. 
Their exchange policy is a joke & customer service is even worse as they are so rude when talking to the customers about their ‚Äòrefund & exchange policy.‚Äô",1,Primark,trustpilot,2019-07-26

"To buy a set or not to buy a set. Take the Primark attitude. WE‚ÄôRE NOT BOTHER Your returns policy has a flaw as we couldn‚Äôt out today when wanting to return an item and it is as follows:
My wife and I purchased item 7474959 NON PAD AOL SET at ¬£5 from your store in Manchester City Center on 6/11/21, my wife was refused the option to try the item on in the changing rooms because ‚Äúit‚Äôs a set and we cannot separate the item‚Äù said the girl in the entrance, okay we will try it on at home we said, we then purchased the item and away we went, having tried the item in my wife found that the bra was too small, even though we purchased her normal size, so today, 7/11/21 we went to the Lancaster store to return only to be told we are not able to return the item as it‚Äôs a set with underwear and we were told in no uncertain terms, by the pointing of fingers, that ‚Äúit‚Äôs on the receipt for you information‚Äù, we informed the supervisor that we were refused the ability to try on in store and that this non-returnable item was not mentioned as non-returnable when we purchased in Manchester. 
After being told again, in not a nice manner, that ‚Äúthey should of told you‚Äù and ‚Äúwe cannot give a refund for this set‚Äù we left the Lancaster store very disappointed with not only the attitude of the supervisor but also the policies of your organisation in that regardless of anything we had done there is not a chance of returning and item that you cannot try and cannot return and primark finish with the statement ‚Äúthis does not affect your statuary rights‚Äù. 
On this occasion myself and my wife had no rights whatsoever in purchasing this item.

When I explained the situation and that I didn't want a refund just to exchange, I was told  that the items were out of time for any refund or exchange, it was company policy. I explained my situation again but to no avail. The items were tried on once at home, did not fit, put back into the bag and returned at the first opportunity. I feel very hard done by as, If I had been allowed to try the clothes on initially, I would not have purchased. Safe to say, I will not be buying anything else from this shop.

"Primark made me cry..... Please Read!!! Please Read!!!! Please Read!!! Please Read!!!!!

Has anyone ever experienced customer service so good that it made you cry?

I have!! Primark, you are truly the most incredible company with the most amazing employees.

I Am getting married in a few months, and I needed 6 x mens 3 piece suits. So I set about finding some, and I couldn't believe the nicest ones I found were at primark priced at only ¬£50 each for the trousers, jacket and waistcoat! such an amazing deal.

I took all of the suit sizes from the groomsmen, and set about buying them...but I couldnt find just one jacket in a size 46R.

I called a few stores, and although they were extremley helpful, there were none available.

So I emailed Primark head office, I explained my situation and my upcoming wedding.... What happened next has floored me!

A customer service coordinator (Lisa Fox) replied, She had contaacted all the stores and revealed that there were no longer any of those Jackets in stock..anywhere!

She went on to explain she had contacted the people that supply these suits, she was told they were discontinued, so she had arranged with them to have one specially made and sent to me..free of charge!! The jacket arrived today in a large box, the jacket was hanging up in the box and attached was a card. I opened the envelope, and there was a beautiful 'greeting card saying 'We wish you all the very best on your wedding day' I am not a softie, and I do not cry, but in this case, my eyes did glaze, I was choked and I had goosebumps, You are all amazing at Primark, and I will tell everyone I know about how wonderful you are.",5,Primark,trustpilot,2015-11-16

When I got into a booth there was dust everywhere, clothes stickers stuck on the ground and the curtain was so stiff it hardly closed or even opened to begin with!
It only got more difficult when I realized that my previous purchase a few weeks before that was separate pins saying 'Trick' 'Or' 'Trick' was sold to me when it was supposed to say 'Trick' 'Or' 'Treat', that may be my fault but all the pins in that Primark said the same thing, so I didn't know any better.

They've changed, but the price hasn't.
The shirts are now thicker, more pale, ill-fitting, shiny & the black colour washes out in just two washes.

"Primark's apathy for Covid-19 security non-compliance is tiring Store visit on Thursday 3 June 2021, Manchester, Market Street

I am so tired of visiting your store and feeling uncomfortable amidst people who refuse to comply with Covid requirements in the store. The queue system presents the most problematic and high risk situation on each visit. To me, the store signage is clear: pay heed to the bright blue signs and markers on the floor. However, it's apparent from my several visits that the average Primark customer is unwilling or unable to stand on equi-distant bright blue floor markers in a queue.

Case in point is my visit to the store today. For reference, the time of my purchase is 20:16. I used the till point on the first floor (ladies). Two individuals in the queue behind me were the type of customer inclined to ignore the social distancing markers. I politely requested that they step further back from me to the next blue marker. They declined, one of them stating ""I'm ignoring you"".

On being served, I asked to speak to management. I spoke with the Supervisor, whose name I believe was on their badge but which I forget. I explained that this was a problem on each visit to the store. I recounted my experiences of being in line at peak times (typically weekends) where there would be an individual conducting ""queue management"", although with varying degrees of proactively. I mentioned that on occasions I had requested these individuals kindly remind those in the queue of the ongoing need to adhere to social distancing and the guidance in store. I also mentioned that typically these requests (although duly acted upon) had little effect.

At this point, I want to be clear that the grievance I am expressing here is not an attack on your store colleagues. They can only do so much while keeping themselves safe. I think that Primark is not doing as much as it can to encourage compliance and respect for social distancing. I will repeat that I think the bright blue markers are clear enough. However, my point is that it is not enough for the average Primark customer.  That much is clear from my experience. I am also sure that much is clear from the experience of your colleagues who have been tasked with queue management, as well as those colleagues who simply pass the queues in which it is evident people are not social distancing. Indeed, it is also clear based on the comments of the Supervisor I spoke to today who acknowledged that some customers do not respect the requirements. Given the clear evidence that signage system and queue management is not enough, it reason to conclude that Primark should try a bit harder.

I appreciate the logistical challenge meaning that it is not efficient to have an individual constantly standing at the queue. Certainly, as I have mentioned there is also always the risk that people will ignore such a person. My suggested feedback is for Primark to enhance the signage at the queues. Specifically, it would assist to have something at eye level rather than just on the floor. The Supervisor in store rebutted this suggestion stating that extra signage of this nature could be a health and safety risk. I find it hard to believe that there are not enough creative types at Primark to come up with some inventive solutions. It is also completely at Primark's discretion to ask customers to leave if they don't follow the house rules. No need to even answer that statement though- I know profit is king. Perhaps you could put additional signage on the products which people are picking up and looking at, which would be likely to get more attention, especially if bright blue. Of course, it may well be that this is all ignored in the manner I have already mentioned. But, given that the behaviour continues, I think Primark should do more, and I would like to know why you are not doing more. In fact, ""more"" may not even be the necessary classification. I think it is better to ask why you are not doing something different. Given that the pandemic is ongoing, and certainly won't be for a while the way things are going, some different action is certainly warranted. And taking different steps would not be overly-onerous given the circumstances. I mean, June 21st isn't looking like such a great date now...I would find it incredulous that you are not aware of the typical conditions in store. So, why aren't you doing something different?",1,Primark,trustpilot,2021-06-04

"Being a mother of a vulnerable child  I‚Ä¶ Being a mother of a vulnerable child  I went into your Rushden lakes Northamptonshire store this morning 27/6/2020 about 9.30 am. 
I was absolutely disgusted with the lack of social distancing in the store , the only stickers on the floor were the ones that were doing the queue to the till point. 
There were no announcements to remind customers to stay 2m away from each other.  There were too many people in the down stairs department everyone was on top of each i
There was only one hand sanitizers at the front of the store once you had already grabbed your basket. 
Customers were in close contact and staff said nothing ( it felt like they didn‚Äôt care ).

"PRIMARK MISSES THE MARK BY A MILE! ONLY PHYSICALY FIT CUSTOMERS WELCOME... Attempted, upon request after weeks of lockdown to take an elderly relative to visit the store on the evening of 17/05/2021: she suffers from poor mobility, ill-health, cannot walk very far, and needs to stop and sit and rest at frequent intervals.

Arrived outside to discover Disabled Parking spaces in front of this and the adjacent vacant retail unit cordoned off as a queuing facility and completely inaccessible, necessitating a 50 yard walk from the nearest available parking space. the intended visit was designed to give the same 86-year-old lady of limited physical means the choice to enjoy and explore a new store in which to actively buy, after COVID restrictions of the last year. She took one look at the situation, shook her head and with a look of dismay and disappointment, headed slowly off to Matalan directly ahead of us.

Annoyed by the clear physical barrier to both her access and enjoyment, I visited the store and challenged the situation with a member of the team who offered an insipid explanation that this was the retail park management's decision, no offer of help or concession given. I pointed out that this action was discriminatory towards the mobility challenged but was offered no remedy and a blank stare, other than the remark 'it's your right!' when I complained. No follow-up action offered.

At this point, further antagonized the by pathetic 'White noise Spiel from a non-descript corporate Chess piece' who clearly wasn't going to do anything other than offer bland and meaningless platitudes, I left. Interestingly, the security guard at the door advised me to use the other door to exit - possibly the first uttering of intelligent life I could glean from a characterless individual of similar stance to the more-human-like primates I once fed bananas to through a grille at the zoo during childhood.

This experience was a total deal-breaker. It will be escalated to the relevant parties / authorities in publicizing yet another large company that puts profits before people, and clearly doesn't give a damn about its customers, so long as they're physically fit and spending money on poor quality merchandise that (from past experience) I would personally never buy, and would be offended by if presented as a gift. However, I have to give some concession to others' choices...

What a fantastic result! Negative feedback accrued before even entering the place - had it not been necessary to leave at least one star by which to complete and submit this review, I would have awarded an extremely well-earned Minus 10. We'll never bother again visiting this low-grade 'Fashion Gin Palace' and will warn others of a similarly infirm nature to avoid at all costs: with vulgar customer service levels and consideration of this nature, this is not a place designed for intelligent or physically challenged people to shop in, and probably goes a long way to adequately describe the 'Social Basement Category' company modus operandum and that of the client base it feeds.

It was with considerable relief that we found the staff at neighbouring Asda (not always my favorite of stores) extremely helpful, as were those at Matalan and M&S, all of whom took time to assist in going the extra mile to help an old lady. Needless to say, their service was duly rewarded.

Outcome: Money wisely spent elsewhere on satisfactory quality goods and great customer service. Will return to those stores that care about their customers and don't put up barriers to ease of access ahead of footfall.

Verdict: Shopped elsewhere happily enough before this 'traffic congestion hazard' came (a blight on Ventura Park in terms of derisive quality, chaos and disorganization), Absolutely no reason to go back to have intelligence insulted for a second time...",1,Primark,trustpilot,2021-05-19

"Primark - breaking point Went into Primark, Tooting SW17 on 13th April around 5:15pm. Queues for the tills reaching breaking point, all the way to the front door and on first and second floors. I was stuck in the queue for around 25 minutes as queues on second floor went all the way back to the escalators with THREE MEMBERS OF STAFF on the tills (absolutely absurd) yet, around 3-4  staff members just folding garments whilst customers unfolded them. I counted around 50 people waiting to be served. I approached  the tills and asked if they could get a few more staff on the tills just to reduce the crowd. Common sense you would think! The manager, named BASIL used his hand to indicate they don't have any staff available whilst speaking the words. Myself and other customers could clearly see the staff around the shop who could have jumped on the till. This is poor management. I would not recommend going into that situation unless you are willing to put up with incompetent senior staff who just don't care or lack basic management skills and have poor attitude and cannot problem solve. I told the manager I would make a complaint and he beckoned me to go ahead. I went back to my place in the queue and watched as the manager Basil went over to talk to '2' staff members whilst looking over towards me as if to complain about me asking for assistance with the queues. If they are able to stand and talk why not jump on the tills!

"In the past I have defended Primark In the past I have defended Primark, cheap and cheerful, does the job. Bought underpants for 14 yeat old .No larger boys sizes in stock so on the advice of an assistant got XS mens. 2 packs, one at ¬£6.50 and one at ¬£7.00. The more expensive ones just fit and are the same as his M&S 12-13 year olds, the cheaper ones are about 3inches narrower unstretched - so about 9-10 years old? Are there men this small? They must be ill ! As it is difficult to judge without taking out of the packaging I assumed I could change them with the receipt.
Apparantly Primark will not take underpants back - ok, but I explained they were not true to size and therefore not fit for purpose. I was dealing with a robot, obviously had missed  the bit about listening to customers before repeating NO.
I agree with people complaining about the customer service, the lady next to me in the queue was also greeted with defensiveness as she tried to get her money back for an item that had disintegrated.

"Not a great First impression Not a great First impression
I visited the new store on opening day in Birmingham City centre.  This is the largest Primark n the country now and it shows.  5 floors of chaos.
When looking for the Harry potter and Disney sections it was a long walk around each floor to find,  not easily visible from the escalators when reaching the floor and then not great content overall.

The harry potter section was tiny and did not contain much at all.  I found nothing in the way of clothing for an adult male and even ventured back down the bottom floor to check the mens section as well but still found nothing.
This was he same with the Disney section which seemed to be limited to kids and women mostly.

It was busy of course as it had just opened as I entered but the service was no different to that found in other Primark stores.

I was cut up by at least 10 members of staff and the multitude of managers clearly from the field and offices seeing their new store opening.  This is something that annoys me in most stores as you are browsing sections.

"Challenging Shopping in Primark I agree can be quite stressful. Too many people getting carried away with cheap clothing, the long line of customers waiting to be served at the till. 

However Working there is no different. It‚Äôs hot, you often have to stand under bright lights that radiate heat, It‚Äôs extreamly dusty, often get home with fibres from the clothes blocking my airways and making my athsma bad. 90% of customers I serve or try to help are extreamly rude and entitled. They would ask for a sale item if it‚Äôs in the back. 100% of the time it won‚Äôt be because erm it‚Äôs in the sale and there is no more left. Yet I often will try to find one anyway or find a similar item that we have a good amount of stock and because I never manage to or they don‚Äôt like the similar item they are rude to me. When I‚Äôm on the tills, they are usually too lazy to go to the right till number or also amazingly expect to be able get a refund etc because they are too lazy to go to refunds and exchanges too. 

Another annoying thing is tables and rails often get overstocked with items. And they often get trashed. The clothes sell out very fast unfortunately hence why everywhere is overstocked. But it leaves us more work to do as for some reason some customers don‚Äôt know how to put an item back on a hanger and on the rail. Or that T‚Äôshirt just gets flung on top until a mountain develops and hides the sizes that everyone wants. Someone will complain their size is not there, but it is. The table is just trashed so badly and it‚Äôs hidden. There is no point in me looking in the back when all the sizes are there. 

We try are absolute best to recover the tables and rails as best as possible, but we often have so many other stuf to do such as help serve on tills or help clear out fitting rooms. Many occasions will be in the process of helping a customer and another customer will ask for help too, then another and another. Many are so impatient. 

Some of the staff we have to work with are a mixed bunch. Some staff members are unfortunately just downright lazy and only do the minimum and leave the work for others to complete even though they had plenty time to complete their task. So that‚Äôs another job for me. 

Some managers and supervisors are helpful. Others aren‚Äôt. They will just walk around the store and give out orders. They will ask you to pick something up even though they are nearest to it and you are busy doing something else. We often get moaned at for not being able to recover all departments but they also moan at us if we are not at the tills. 

And when the store is closed, we are still having to serve customers 20 mins past closing time. We are not allowed to leave on time or even a minute late, we have to stay until all customers go home. There is always that last customer who decides to have 3 baskets worth of shopping and decide she doesn‚Äôt want the items after us scanning them. They would decide she has left her card at home or in the car. 

The fitting rooms are just as bad. Customers will come in with about 20 outfits and decide they don‚Äôt want any of them which is fine. But then some come back and decided they wanted them and because the clothes have been put out they get mad about it.",5,Primark,trustpilot,2018-06-20

Low and behold, upon opening the cannister, I was shocked to discover there were only 3 small cookies within which were soft enough to disintigrate as I took them out. The cannister was 13cms tall with a diameter of 7cms. Similarly each box of tea, which measure 6cm cubed, contained 3 tea bags. Surely this is false advertising.

"Primark Corby - SIZING AWFUL, DIFFERS  FOR SAME ITEMS. I purchased quite a few clothing items on the lead up to Christmas.  3 of the shirts all in large, were the same just different colours.  Each shirt even though large was a different size, 1 far to small, large size on label.  One okey, large on label, one massive, large on label.  Made in Turkey..... Primark need to sort out these different sizes for same label size. Didnt take back, but have lost money on this a 2 shirts cannot use.  Quality has usually been good, they are good value, dont expect the items to last ages, but sizing is awful.  Check all the sizes in every item before you buy, not the label but if the item fits as it should.",1,Primark,trustpilot,2018-01-17

I would make sure to check the prices as you are getting rung out because if it‚Äôs not resolved in the store then you lose out on money.

Staff were nice, displays were not jumble-saley but come ON Primark - you are missing out on a huge portion of potential sales here. We want more of the larger sizes PLEASE.

"Oversizing? I have shopped there for years buying, amongst other things  their high leg briefs and I have always been happy with the fit. Recently needing to replace some old pairs, I bought two packs of four. When I opened them and saw their ""new improved sizing""  I compared them with my existing pairs, the new ones which had increased in size at the top of the briefs by FOUR inches would be miles too big and unwearable, compounded also by the fact that stretch is non existent unlike my old one giving a snug, comfortable fit.
. Of course I can't return them so I'm stuck with eight unwearable, unreturnable pairs. I had also bought a sweatshirt in my normal size which again with the new improved sizing  would now fit my husband but this, fortunately, I can return. Customer services expressed their dismay at my disappointment but no solution, apparently this is all the result of customer feedback. While some adjustment may have been necessary an increase of four inches in size is ridiculous particularly in underwear that cannot be tried on or returned. I would have thought that standardisation in sizing was more necessary. How many others have been caught out like me but couldn't be bothered to complain? Just to update, I took the sweatshirt back and, joy, six years after giving up smoking and going up a size to a 14 I have now dropped to a 10/12 with no effort whatsoever.

"EXTREMELY RUDE STAFF!!! Let me start off by saying I'm not one to be complaining about anything but seeing as my three year old son witnessed the disrespect from one of your staff I just had to as I DO NOT want what has happened to me today happening to anyone one else 

I went into the Marble Arch store with my son and sister and bought a few items, As I was heading to the tills to pay, my sister and son was behind me making a way for a wheelchair user, the lady that served me (NAME: HANDE) started raising her voice by telling my sister to get out of the damn way and said clearly in a loud tone of voice ""can you not see the wheelchair behind you are you blind"" bare in mind my sister was already making way for the wheelchair user, she has spoken to us as if we did not understand Any English...not only has her employees whom she was giggling and laughing with witnessed it but so did the customers that was lining up to be served, in all honesty she could have said it in a polite respectful manner as any other respectful person would

So I let that go as I did not want my son seeing me upset,..As I was paying the lady was laughing and not paying any attention to me as I have asked her politely how much an item was, she replied back by saying can you not see the price is on the tag, and continued gossiping with her colleague, not only was there a queue building up but some customers felt a bit uncomfortable with the lady's attitude and the way she was speaking to me..

After paying I was not given a receipt and have asked for my receipt in which she threw away so she picked up my reciept from the floor and threw it On the table, this has P***** me off as I will not tolerate this sort of behaviour, I've asked for her name in which she has given me the wrong one..I've asked to speak to the manager in which she replied that her manager was not available for complaints so I had to speak to one of her colleagues in which has directed me to her manager, she got a bit nervous and started to panic to the colleague she was laughing and giggling with as she knew what she did was wrong but seemed defensive when her manager was speaking to her, not only was she giving attitude to her manager but was talking at me by saying why you complaining for, her manager had no option but to call another manager who was higher up, I think her name was Barbara which was very helpful as she has calmed the situation down but the till lady (HANDE which is her name) was still talking under her nose making a scene making sure she has support from her colleagues to defend her which was very childish 

This is Not Acceptable whatsoever and I do believe this person should not be working at a very well known UK Company. Not only was it a large store but a store which is located in the centre of London.

When I stated this to the supervisor, I was referred to a notice in the corner, on the wall behind the tills, where the policy is stated in such tiny print that I couldn‚Äôt read it (my sight with my glasses is very good!).

"Primark living in the dark ages Kingston upon Thames branch please take note. 
Kingston branch used to be one of your best branches.  The floor space divided between men and women was an acceptable ratio to the footfall through your doors.  Why then oh why have you now made the divide so great that I for one will not bother stepping in any Primark store again. Why you should feel the need to cut back on the amount of floor space given to menswear in this particular store is unbelievable.  You did it first a couple of months ago, now you have cut the menswear again leaving it with half the original floor space it used to occupy. I always used to use this branch as it stocked the widest range of your menswear.  I have visited quite a few of your stores around the country and believe me, none of them could shine a light on Kingston branch for the variety and choice men had. So many items not available in your other stores (including the measly floor space given over to menswear in your Oxford Street branches)
To be honest with you,  you have made a huge mistake.  Kingston branch was always an amazing shopping experience for men and women. Now, just as with every other store you have (that I have been to anyway) you have turned it into another ""let's cut back and back on menswear store. Let's expand on homeware,  ladies fashion and every other department at the expense of menswear.""
You had a great customer base of men shopping in this store because you had such a wide range of menswear. You will now notice a huge fall in footfall of men, lads, guys through your doors.  It used to be an exceptional shopping experience for men,  women, couples families.  Now it is just another boring place for men to shop. Fifty percent less floorspace for menswear? Fifty percent less choice for men. You have turned this store into every one of your other stores that I would not go out of my was to shop in. Kingston branch used to be a shopping experience for both men and women.  Now unfortunately you have gone the route of Top Shop, Chelsea Girl, Concept Man and countless other fashion retail outlets, you have alienated the males from bothering to visit this store. You have taken away any reason I had for going to  this store.  And, I would imagine that male footfall through your doors will now drop and continue to drop, because you have taken away the ""shopping experience for men"". Given them no reason to visit any of your stores, ""just to browse"". Did you not realise that men, as with women,  purchase far more than they would have done given the opportunity to browse a wider selection of goods? It was a case of ""oh yeah, hadn't thought of buying that until I saw it while browsing"" and men spending more money and time in this particular branch due to the amount they could browse.  Has somebody at head office done the maths? Does the money to be made on the expansion of other departments outweigh the loss you will receive from the menswear department?
I for one hope it doesn't.  You were probably the first chain to give men a reason to bother to go into town outside of pub hours, a reason to actually want to visit your store.  Now, you have taken that away.  This isn't the seventies when men would wear the items their womenfolk picked up for them, when men didn't use deodorant, before men actually realised that they were entitled to have a good selection of different styles of clothing made available to them. The days before men's beauty products actually even existed on the shop floor (unlike now as it's probably a 70/30 split, that's a 70/30 split which in case you didn't realise the extra 30% never actually existed before.)
Men actually purchase more products for themselves than at any other time in living history.  The more choice they have,  the more they spend.  The greater chances Primark had of cashing in on this never before witnessed phenomenon in the male community (men actually purchasing beauty products, browsing menswear departments,  picking out their own idea of fashion and what looks good on them). What you have now done is taken the shopping experience for men back to the dark ages. To a time men would not have wanted to go beauty product shopping or even think of what men's fashion was. 
But guess what, men of all ages and persuasions, cultures and backgrounds LOVE shopping for themselves as much as women love shopping for themselves. You may shove a few more household items in your shelves,  but who is going to buy them? You are creating a divide again, a divide that will now alienate men from the high streets. Times had changed and Primark was at the forefront of those changes.  Now you are turning those loyal customers away by cutting the choice they will have within your stores. Women's clothing and choice would never have been cut at the expense of other products, so why does Primark feel they have the right to take away men's choices?",1,Primark,trustpilot,2021-10-04

Awful customer service Folkestone branch Awful customer service from their Folkestone branch and head office after complaining. They simply are not interested. All I wanted to do was exchange an item for a more expensive item and pay the difference but as it had been a gift I did not have the receipt so they would not allow me to exchange it. They implied that they lose a lot of stock like this so I told them to keep the item and walked out. Perhaps this will help to lessen their losses at the expense of a lost customer. Come on Primark...you lost a customer for ¬£3.50 was it really worth it. And I let you keep the item anyway as I would never wear it. Really bad customer service they just laughed at me in the store.

Went into Wood Green Primark quickly to get some bits for some son who is chronically ill. Because I was in a rush I shoved my phone in my pocket and of course some lowlife pickpocketed me. 

So far none of this is the fault of Primark. 

The security guard was really good and checked CCTV - confirmed the time and place and told me to report to the police so they could identify the person. Also told me that it had happened about 8 times in two days. 

Well, the police got permission to view CCTV but told me that the Branch Manager refused to let them see it. I made a complaint which surprise, surprise, has been ignored.

The store would not exchange it for a larger size and when I questioned the sizing, they suggested I write to Customer Services. I did this but without success -all I got was a repetition of the policy -no receipt no exchange. It seems daft to alienate customers like myself who actually are genuine given I only wanted a different size, but I guess the clothes are so cheap and the amount sold so vast, they can afford to lose customers. If I do shop there again, I will take some safety pins with me (easy to keep a few in my bag), and pin the receipt to the garment tag. I joked with the sales assistant in the store that receipts could be stapled to tags but she said that staplers are most probably banned due to health and safety reasons (!!!).

"Unfortunately I found out the hard way‚Ä¶receipts Unfortunately I found out the hard way how difficult they are about returns or exchanges without a receipt and feel if they are to be so tight about it they should offer to email receipts rather than have people rely on bits of paper.
Even with this problem this can happen but I have multiple conditions that affect my cognitive function and have genuinely misplaced one of 2 receipts, possibly even accidently thrown it away and I cannot remember despite it only being just over a week ago. 
I needed an exchange as the item I bought for my daughter didn't fit, and due to covid restrictions, the changing rooms were closed so had no choice but to buy them to try at home. Unfortunately they didn't fit so wanted to exchange for the next size. 
Which were as sods law would have it on the receipt I misplaced. 
Never thought for a second an exchange would be an issue. I was flat out refused despite offering proof of purchase by way of my bank statement showing over ¬£200 worth of goods in a week. They would not look up the transaction in their records either and weren't even really apologetic. I feel discretion could be used. The receipt I did have showed I spend over a ¬£100 which surely should prove my Value as a customer.
Clearly that means nothing.
While they don't have the best quality clothes, while my daughter is still growing it provided a cheap and cheerful solution to getting her some new things that don't need to last, However the value is lost if I am stuck with items that are of no use.

"Good prices, usually good quality I always pop into Primark when I am out shopping and I will usually love everything I see or not see anything that I like at all. It's very 50/50 when I walk into Primark even though I do usually find it very nice and the products of good quality. Though you can probably find better quality elsewhere, at the prices in Primark it is a given. 

Though I noticed that the Primark prices are getting higher, especially on the Atmosphere range, which unfortunately, is most of the women's section. 

Tops in that section have gone from being ¬£5 to ¬£8, and from ¬£8 to ¬£12. I know that they aren't massive increases, but when you are buying a lot of items, those price increases can end up adding an extra ¬£20 onto your shopping trip.

I do think that the quality of the products in Primark are reliably good, and if you happen to get an anomaly, in which your product shrinks, stretches, rips ect. You haven't wasted that much money- but with increasing prices, I would be more angry if I found that my product isn't to standard.

"Lack of customer service Primark was always my first place if I wanted to but anything specially nails. Last week I had two pounds on me so I decided to get nails from there. U picked so many nails and was confused which two shall go for. After deciding took two put the.in my pocket and the rest took them back to where it were. Went to cashier, paid for them two. When I wanted to leave the shop floor one man came up to me asking me to go back to the shop floor. I was scared uncomfortable, wondering what did I do. I‚Äôve told me what happened. He made me feel like I‚Äôm a thief. He was wearing normal clothes not an uniform. He literally took me and force me to go to the shop floor front of everyone, everybody were in the shop were looking at me as if I stole stuff. After he checked that I have bought and paid for the nails he didn‚Äôt say sorry or apologies. This was unacceptable so I went to the supervisor she said ‚Äúsorry for what happened with you what do you want me to do now?‚Äù In my head was really? I left straightaway couldn‚Äôt say a word and I will never will go back there anymore. This was happened in Luton primark store",1,Primark,trustpilot,2019-08-03
"Primark  please Stop sexualising our‚Ä¶ Primark  please Stop sexualising our kids. I‚Äôve been to new look, primark, and H&M and in every kids/girls section the only clothes that they sell for young girls are clothes that provocative and sexy why would I want my 9 year old daughter to look sexy this is madness it seems to me that these franchise company‚Äôs are really trying to sexualise young girls what‚Äôs wrong with this country? And when I ask the staff at primark what‚Äôs going on they just shrug there shoulders an give me no EXPLANATION? I‚Äôll never spend another penny in at primark again until they show some respect for our kids",1,Primark,trustpilot,2021-06-09
"Disappointed Went shopping in Liverpool today, I‚Äôve never been served by such rude staff. The lady serving me never said a word because she was deep in conversation with the staff member on the next till. There was no please or thank you. I wanted to ask about returns if item wasn‚Äôt right as it was a Christmas present but never got the chance as my bag was shoved at me. I did look for a manager on way out but didn‚Äôt see one. I shop in Chester, Stafford  or Wrexham primark usually and have never had a problem wIth staff there they are lovely.",1,Primark,trustpilot,2019-12-03

"Primark MK1 Milton Keynes Visited Primark MK1 in Milton Keynes and was very disappointed with the range of sizes. The majority of clothes were sizes 6 to 12, some of them were up to size 14. Usually I buy sizes 14-16 but Primark sizes are smaller than in other shops. The same situation with bras: only small sizes. I approached a staff member to ask if they had my size for one of the items I chose just to hear that they didn‚Äôt and that I needed to go to a plus size shop! This is disgraceful. Will not be coming back to this shop ever.",1,Primark,trustpilot,2020-09-09
"SHORT CHANGED‚Ä¶.. SHORT CHANGED‚Ä¶.., I had to leave a one star about my experience but really it should be 0. If possible pay by card in Primark. I paid for a couple of items with cash and was shortchanged. I told the girl serving me I had given her a ¬£10 not ¬£5 which she then responded by saying I hadn‚Äôt. She then went to speak with a colleague and I could hear her saying that I was lying. I asked for the till to be checked and was told it was correct and I asked to see cctv. I was told I couldn‚Äôt but it would be checked by a manager. I was in the store for about an hour and a half while all this was going on. The manager eventually came to me to and said the cctv had been checked and I hadn‚Äôt given ¬£10 but ¬£5. I was made to feel like a criminal I was upset and could not believe how badly I had been treated. I worked in retail for years and would never have treated a customer this way. I wrote to Primark and asked for a copy of the cctv footage. After many emails and being passed around different departments, customer services and then their legal department, I eventually received it. And of course it shows me paying with a ¬£10 note. I then emailed their legal department AGAIN and was told I would be passed back to customer services. But they never contacted me and still to this day I have received no apology or an offer of retuning my money. I am disgusted. I know it is a small amount of money but it is more about the principle and the shocking customer service at Primark.",1,Primark,trustpilot,2021-07-02
